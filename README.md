# üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yoga Session Prototype App

A Flutter-based yoga session player that dynamically loads yoga flows from JSON ‚Äî including pose images, audio instructions, and real-time captions with progress tracking. This was developed as part of an internship assignment.

## üß© How It Works

- The app loads `poses.json` at runtime and parses it into:
  - Metadata (title, category, loop count)
  - Audio references
  - Poses with start/end times and image references
- Each script segment is played with audio and caption text
- Progress bar updates every 200ms based on timer
- Audio and images are synced using the timing defined in JSON

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note About Audio/Caption Sync

There may be **minor mismatches between the audio and captions** during playback.  
This is **not a bug in the app**, but due to how segment timings are defined in the `poses.json` file:

> ‚è± The app follows the `startSec` and `endSec` values strictly to schedule caption updates and segment transitions.

If you notice any out-of-sync issues:
- Please adjust the `startSec`/`endSec` values in the JSON to better align with the actual voice-over timing.
- Sync is fully controllable and customizable through the JSON script.
